###### Note for Windows users:

If you run into issues with ansible complaining about executable permissions, try modifying the `Vagrantfile`'s `synced_folder` entry from this:

```ruby
  config.vm.synced_folder ".", "/vagrant"
```

to this:

```ruby
  config.vm.synced_folder ".", "/vagrant", mount_options: [“dmode=700,fmode=600″]
```
